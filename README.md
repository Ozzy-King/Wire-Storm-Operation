this is a server for Operation Wire-Storm. it allows multiple destiniation connections and one source and will broadcast packet from the source to the destinations.

## how to run
1) ```cd``` into the working directory with main.cpp in
2) in terminal run```g++ main.cpp```
3) then run the server with ``` ./a.out```
4) from here you can run the tests found in wire-storm with ```python3 tests.py```

if there is no files in wire-storm you can get the files with ```git clone https://github.com/CoreTechSecurity/wire-storm.git```
